# AGGMap2.0

This repository contains data and utilities for processing aggregate facility information.

## Files

CSV data files are stored in the `DATA` directory:

- `DATA/AGGDATA.csv` – Raw facility data exported from LIMS.
- `DATA/AGGDATA_cleaned.csv` – Deduplicated records used by the map interface.
- `DATA/Approved Products.csv` – Approved products list.
- `DATA/All ProducersNot.csv` – Producer information.

Other repository files:
- `index.html` – Prototype web map interface that loads `DATA/AGGDATA_cleaned.csv` by default.
